Retro mini-games made with STONE touch screen


Hi, my name is Amber. I am an amateur electronics enthusiast who likes to do my own electronic DIY. I can use various microcontrollers such as arduino, esp32, raspberry pi, etc. If you have questions about my documentation please feel free to leave a comment to let me know.


Finally, I hope that my files will help those who need help and that those who see my files will like my project.
